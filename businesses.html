        We cannot forget the fact that businesses also contribute to carbon emissions,
        <br> manufacturing institutions such as factories have significantly high carbon 
        <br>emissions. Here are some examples of how businesses can reduce their carbon footprint:
    <p class="h2">Using green energy</p>    
        <p class="p">Like I said in the first page, the burning of fossil fuels is what creates 
            <br>greenhouse gas emissions so if a business switches to using a 
            <br>renewable energy source such as wind energy or solar power, it will 
            <br>most definitely reduce the carbon footprint. 
            <br>
            <br>
        </p>
    <p class="h2">Using recycled materials</p>
        <p class="p">Instead of using brand new materials to make a product, a business 
            <br>can use recycled materials to make their products. This is not a 
            <br>commonly known fact but landfills also have greenhouse emissions,
            <br> a lot of emissions actually.
            <br>
            <br>
        </p>
    <p class="h2">Switch to online meetings and events</p>
        <p class="p">
        Transportation methods such as driving and flying have large carbon 
        <br>footprints, if a business does only or mostly online events and meetings, 
        <br>that is reducing their carbon footprint.
        </p>

    <p class="h3">
        Examples of companies that have made efforts to 
        <br>reduce their carbon footprints
    </p>
    <p class="p">
        Apple - It has a goal for each apple device that is sold will have zero-net 
        <br>climate impact. It currently is carbon neutral and the Apple Headquarters
        <br> uses solar energy that powers 75% of their energy usage.
        <br>
        <br>
        Easyjet - Easyjet is an airline. Planes do have really high carbon emissions, 
        <br>a plane that travels short international flights would be estimated to emit
        <br> 3.15 grams of carbon for every 1 gram of fuel. Easyjet has made commendable
        <br> efforts in trying to reduce their carbon footprint, they did this by implementing
        <br> a carbon offset.
        <br>
        <br>
        BMW - BMW is an automobile company and similarly to Easyjet, makes
        <br> commendable efforts to reduce their carbon emissions. “from 2009 to 
        <br> 2019 BMW has been able to reduce its delivery fleet emissions by over
        <br> 40%” they have started using renewable fuels.
