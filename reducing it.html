<p id="intro">
    The global carbon footprint average is around 4 tons, but it all depends on where you are. 
    <br>For example, the average American emits around 16.1 tons of carbon annually and in the 
    <br>Democratic Republic of Congo, the average person emits only 0.03 tons annually. No matter 
    <br>how much carbon you as an individual emit, here are some ways to reduce your carbon footprint.

    <p class="subheading">While Traveling</p>
    <div>
        <H2 class="h21">Reduce driving</H2>
        <p class="text1">
            A typical car produces around 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide 
            <br>annually so going one year without a car can save up to a whole
            <br> 2.6 tons of carbon dioxide. Of course getting rid of your car is a 
            <br>personal decision but try to reduce it or substitute using your car 
            <br>to public transportation such as trains, buses or ride a bike. Try 
            <br>carpooling when you can. Diving well can also partially reduce 
            <br>your carbon footprint.
            <br>
            <br>
            If you want to buy a car, consider buying a cheaper car because 
            <br>they tend to produce less emissions or consider buying an electric car.
        </p>
        <h2 class="h21">Fly less</h2>
        <p class="text1">
            Next time you consider going on a vacation abroad, try taking a staycation, however as of now flying is the only way to travel fast far away. Reducing the amount of flights can reduce your carbon footprint significantly.
        </p>

    <p class="subheading1">With your meals</p>
        <h2 class="h22">Reduce meat</h2>
        <p class="text2">
            Cutting meat out of your diet is 800kgs of carbon dioxide out of the
            <br> atmosphere annually.This is becauseof the production of meat, a lot 
            <br>of trees get cut down to create pastures for breeding cows. Cows also 
            <br>produce methane and animals take up alot of feed and water to farm. “Having
            <br> a vegan diet is likely to be the best for the environment, experts say. A vegetarian 
            <br>or pescetarian diet is also likely to be better for the environment.

    <p class="subheading2">Inside your house</p>
        <p class="text3">
            Turning off the lights in a room on average can save up to ⅓ kgs of carbon dioxide per day. 
            <br>Doing other activities such as wearing a sweater instead of turning up the temperature, using
            <br> LED lights or hanging clothes on a line and not using a dryer can also reduce your carbon footprint.<br> 
            Recycling old items and not buying items that are heavily wrapped in plastic.
        </p>

<p class="disclaimer">
    An easy misconception to believe though is that you can fix climate change. Well you cannot, you are one person out of the billions of people in this world, let alone businesses. You doing these activities such eating less meat or driving less will definitely help with your carbon footprint but right now, we have damaged the environment so badly that the only way that I believe to fix it is systemically. With governments implacing laws, not laws like banning plastic bags but laws like the main supplier of energy for the country to be solar powered for example. You doing things to reduce your personal carbon footprint should not be something that you do to feel bad about being harmful to the environment, but something you do because you care about the environment, it may make a small impact in to the environment but you doing it will possibly, most likely influence others to do it, at least some of it.
