            <p class="text">Yes that title is dramatic and seems exaggerated, but don‚Äôt be mistaken. It is completely true. All that harm that people have done to this Earth,
                <br> from polluting the land and oceans, to overexploitation of natural resources and even making animals go extinct. Yes, these things happen and
                <br> are happening currently. According to The World Counts, In 2019, approximately 43.1 billion tons of CO2 were released into the atmosphere as 
                <br> a result of human activities. If this website were to discuss all these topics, it would be too long, so this website covers the issue of carbon emissions
                <br> and carbon footprint. How to reduce your carbon footprint and how businesses can too. In case you don‚Äôt want to read all the information, there 
                <br> are also videos and images on the website. </p>
