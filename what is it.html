    <h2>Greenhouse gases</h2>
    <P>Greenhouse gasses are gasses that trap heat in the Earth’s atmosphere.
        <br> There are seven kinds of major greenhouse gasses that are produced by
        <br> humans, these include: 
        <ol>
            <li>Carbon dioxide</li>
            <li>Methane</li>
            <li>Nitrous oxide</li>
            <li>Hydrofluorocarbons</li>
            <li>Perfluorocarbons</li>
            <li>Sulfur hexafluoride</li>
            <li>Nitrogen trifluoride</li>
        </ol>
    </P>



        <h2>Effects of greenhouse gasses</h2>
        <p>The sun shines through the atmosphere during the day, warming the earth's
            <br> surface. The earth's surface cools at night, releasing heat into the atmosphere.
            <br> However, part of the heat is trapped in the atmosphere by greenhouse gasses. 
            <br>“According to NOAA's 2020 Annual Climate Report the combined land and
            <br> ocean temperature has increased at an average rate of 0.13 degrees Fahrenheit 
            <br>( 0.08 degrees Celsius) per decade since 1880; however, the average rate of
            <br> increase since 1981 (0.18°C / 0.32°F) has been more than twice that rate.”
            <br> This causes the earth to overheat. If the earth becomes too hot, many 
            <br>ecosystems are in danger of undergoing drastic changes that would result 
            <br>in the extinction of their natural biomes. For example, the number of plants 
            <br>will drop by half, there will be more heatwaves, and rising sea levels. </p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;


        <h2>How are greenhouse gases released</h2>
        <p>Greenhouse gasses, specifically carbon dioxide, is released when an activity 
            <br>that needs energy is done for example driving a car or using a television.
            <br> This is because most of the energy that is used comes from burning fossil fuels. </p>
